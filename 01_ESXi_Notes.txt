This playbook performs the initial setup of the host for the NUC lab, but the VMware ansible module can't upload files directly to a host datastore, so some manual steps are required after running this playbook.

Prerequisits:
1. Ansible 2.8
2. pyvmomi module (required by the VMware Ansible modules)
     pip install pyvmomi
3. ESX must be installed and the IP/hostname/dns domains must be configured in the console interface

Running the playbook:
1. Edit the vars.yml file as required
2. Run the playbook
    ansible-playbook 01_ESXi_Config.yml

Installing the VAAI Vib:
1. Upload the VAAI vib to the host's local datastore (datastore1)
2. SSH to the host and run the following command:
     esxcli software vib install -v /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/NetAppNasPlugin.v23.vib 
3. reboot the esxi host
